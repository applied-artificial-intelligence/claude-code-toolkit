## Quick Reference

**Workflow**: `/workflow:explore` -> `/workflow:plan` -> `/workflow:next` -> `/workflow:ship`

## Project Preferences

- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Run tests before committing
- Use conventional commits

## Context Management

Check context usage: `/context`
- <70%: Continue normally
